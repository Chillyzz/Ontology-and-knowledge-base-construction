# Tricky Concepts

1. Floor and Ceiling Functions (Specific individual)
2. Logarithm & Exponents (Operator as concepts: Is it need to write them all? The difference between concept and operator)
3. Square Roots



# Operators(暂不考虑)

6. Union (并集): The set of all elements that are in either of two sets (or both).  
   *Example:* \( A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3\} \cup \{3, 4, 5\} = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\} \).

7. Intersection (交集): The set of all elements that are in both sets.  
   *Example:* \( A \cap B = \{1, 2, 3\} \cap \{3, 4, 5\} = \{3\} \).

8. Difference (差集): The set of elements that are in one set but not in the other.  
   *Example:* \( A - B = \{1, 2, 3\} - \{3, 4, 5\} = \{1, 2\} \).

9. Complement (补集): The set of all elements in the universal set that are not in the given set.  
   *Example:* If \( U = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\} \) and \( A = \{1, 2, 3\} \), then the complement of \(A\) is \( A^c = \{4, 5\} \).

10. Cardinality (基数): The number of elements in a set.  
    *Example:* The cardinality of \( A = \{1, 2, 3\} \) is \( |A| = 3 \).

12. Venn Diagram (文氏图): A diagram used to represent sets and their relationships, with circles representing sets.  
    *Example:* A Venn diagram can show the union and intersection of two sets.

13. Logical Statement (逻辑语句): A declarative sentence that is either true or false.  
    *Example:* "2 is an even number" is a logical statement.

14. Negation (否定): The logical operation that reverses the truth value of a statement.  
    *Example:* The negation of "It is raining" is "It is not raining".

15. Conjunction (合取): The logical operation "AND," where the result is true if both statements are true.  
    *Example:* "It is raining AND it is cold."

16. Disjunction (析取): The logical operation "OR," where the result is true if at least one of the statements is true.  
    *Example:* "It is raining OR it is snowing."

17. Implication (蕴含): A logical statement of the form "If P, then Q," where the truth of P implies the truth of Q.  
    *Example:* "If it rains, then the ground will be wet."

18. Biconditional (双条件): A logical statement of the form "P if and only if Q," where P and Q are either both true or both false.  
    *Example:* "You will pass the exam if and only if you study."

19. Truth Table (真值表): A table used to show the truth value of a compound statement for all possible truth values of its components.  
    *Example:* A truth table for the conjunction \( P \land Q \) shows the truth value for all possible combinations of \(P\) and \(Q\).

20. Tautology (恒真式): A logical statement that is always true, regardless of the truth values of its components.  
    *Example:* "It is either raining or it is not raining" is a tautology.

21. Contradiction (矛盾式): A logical statement that is always false, regardless of the truth values of its components.  
    *Example:* "It is raining and it is not raining" is a contradiction.

22. Quantifiers (量词): Words used in logic to express the extent of a statement, such as "for all" (universal quantifier) or "there exists" (existential quantifier).  
    *Example:* "For all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \), \( x^2 \geq 0 \)" (Universal Quantifier).

23. Logical Equivalence (逻辑等价): Two logical statements are logically equivalent if they have the same truth value in all cases.  
    *Example:* \( P \rightarrow Q \) is logically equivalent to \( \neg P \lor Q \).

24. Set-builder Notation (集合描述法): A shorthand used to define sets by specifying the properties that its members must satisfy.  
    *Example:* \( A = \{x \mid x \text{ is an even number}\} \).

25. Exponent \\in Expression: (As a operator)
