    Formal: HarmonicMean = n / (Σ (1/x_i) for i=1 to n)

Concept: WeightedMean
    Definition: The weighted mean is an average in which each quantity to be averaged is assigned a weight.
    Formal: WeightedMean = (Σ (weight_i * value_i)) / Σ (weight_i)

Concept: Average
    Definition: A number that represents the central or typical value in a set of data, calculated by dividing the sum of the values in the set by their number.
