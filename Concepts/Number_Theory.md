## Numbers

1. PalindromicNumber: A number that remains the same when its digits are reversed.  
   Example: 121 and 1331 are palindromic numbers.

2. MersenneNumber: A number of the form \( 2^n - 1 \).  
    Example: \( 31 = 2^5 - 1 \) is a Mersenne number.

3. PerfectSquare: A number that is the square of an integer.  
    Example: 49 is a perfect square because \( 49 = 7^2 \).

4. SinglyEvenNumber: A singly even number is a number that is divisible by 2 but not by 4.  
    Example: 6 is a singly even number because \( 6 \div 2 = 3 \) but \( 6 \div 4 \) is not an integer.

5. Predecessor: A predecessor is a number that comes immediately before another number in a sequence. For any integer \( n \), the predecessor is \( n-1 \).  
    Example: The predecessor of 5 is 4.

6. Successor: The successor of a number is the number that comes immediately after it in a given sequence, often obtained by adding one to it.  
    Example: The successor of 7 is 8.

7. Reciprocal: The reciprocal of a number is 1 divided by that number. It's the multiplicative inverse of the number.  
   Example: The reciprocal of 5 is \( \frac{1}{5} \).

8. Remainder: The remainder is the amount left over after division when one number does not evenly divide into another.  
   Example: When dividing 10 by 3, the remainder is 1.



## Primes

1. Twin_Primes: Pairs of prime numbers that have a difference of two.  
   **Example:** \( (3, 5) \) and \( (11, 13) \) are twin primes.  

2. Mersenne_Prime: A prime number of the form \(2^p - 1\), where \( p \) is also a prime.  
   **Example:** \( 31 = 2^5 - 1 \) is a Mersenne prime.  

3. Fermat_Prime: A prime number of the form \(2^{2^n} + 1\), where \( n \) is a non-negative integer.  
   **Example:** \( 5 = 2^{2^1} + 1 \) is a Fermat prime.  

4. Palindromic_Prime: A prime number that is also a palindrome.  
   **Example:** \( 131 \) is a palindromic prime.  (Palindromic: 111, 222...)

5. Factorial_Prime: A prime number that is one less or one more than a factorial, \( n! \pm 1 \).  
   **Example:** \( 5 = 3! + 1 \) is a factorial prime.  


## Fractions


1. Mediant: The mediant is a fraction formed by adding the numerators of two fractions and adding the denominators of those fractions to form a new fraction.  
    Example: The mediant of \( \frac{1}{4} \) and \( \frac{2}{5} \) is \( \frac{3}{9} \).

2. MixedFraction: A mixed fraction is a whole number combined with a fraction, such as \( 1 \frac{3}{4} \).  
    Example: \( 2 \frac{1}{2} \) is a mixed fraction.

3. UnitFraction: A fraction where the numerator is 1 and the denominator is a positive integer.  
    Example: \( \frac{1}{2} \) is a unit fraction.

4. ProperFraction: A fraction where the numerator is less than the denominator, meaning it represents a part of a whole.  
   Example: \( \frac{3}{4} \) is a proper fraction.

5. Fraction: A representation of a part of a whole, consisting of a numerator and a denominator.  
   Example: \( \frac{5}{8} \) is a fraction.

6. ReducedFraction: A fraction in which the numerator and denominator have no common factors other than 1.  
    Example: \( \frac{6}{8} \) reduces to \( \frac{3}{4} \).

7. ReducibleFraction: A fraction that can be simplified or reduced by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by a common factor greater than 1.  
    Example: \( \frac{8}{12} \) is a reducible fraction, which simplifies to \( \frac{2}{3} \).

8. CommonFraction: A way of expressing a number as the quotient of two integers, where the numerator is divided by the denominator. It is also known as a simple or vulgar fraction.  
    Example: \( \frac{7}{9} \) is a common fraction.

9. ImproperFraction: A fraction where the numerator is greater than or equal to the denominator.  
    Example: \( \frac{5}{3} \) is an improper fraction.

10. IrreducibleFraction: A fraction in which the numerator and the denominator are coprime; meaning their greatest common divisor is 1, and it cannot be simplified further.  
    Example: \( \frac{7}{11} \) is an irreducible fraction because gcd(7, 11) = 1.
