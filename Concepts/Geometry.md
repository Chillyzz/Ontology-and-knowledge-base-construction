## Point,Line and Plane 点线面（关联公理及顺序公理）
1. Point : A point is a precise location in space with no length, width, or thickness. It is usually represented by a dot and is labeled by a letter (e.g., point \(A\)).
2. Line : A line is a straight one-dimensional figure that extends infinitely in both directions. It has no thickness and is typically represented with two arrows at the ends (e.g., line \(AB\)).
3. LineSegment \\ on Line: A part of a line that has two endpoints. The length of a line segment can be measured.
4. Ray \\ on Line : A part of a line that starts at one point and extends infinitely in one direction. It has one endpoint and is represented by an arrow in one direction.

5. Vector \\ on Line : A vector is a mathematical object that has both magnitude (length) and direction.

6. Plane : A flat, two-dimensional surface that extends infinitely in all directions. It is often represented by a four-sided figure or the letter \(P\).
7. Half-Plane \\ on Plane : A half-plane is a region of a two-dimensional plane that is divided by a straight line into two parts. One of these parts is called a half-plane, and it consists of all points on one side of the dividing line.

8. OrderedLine \\ on Line : The Line having order on it, similar to the real line.

## Angle 角
1. Angle \\ on Plane : An angle is formed by two rays (sides) that share a common endpoint (the vertex). Angles are measured in degrees (°).


# Polygon 多边形
1. Polygon : a 2D geometric figure made up of straight line segments (called sides) that are connected to form a closed figure.

## Triangle 三角形
1. Triangle \\ in Polygon : polygon with three sides and three angles.

## Quadrilateral 四边形
1. Quadrilateral \\ in Polygon : A polygon with four sides.
2. Trapezoid \\ in Polygon : A quadrilateral with one pair of parallel sides.
3. Parallelogram \\ in Trapezoid : Opposite sides are equal and parallel.
4. Rectangle \\ in Parallelogram : Four right angles, opposite sides are equal.
5. Rhombus \\ in Parallelogram : A parallelogram with all sides equal.
6. Square \\ in Rectangle, in Rhombus : Four equal sides and four right angles.

## Polyhedron 多面体
1. Polyhedron : A polyhedron is a three-dimensional geometric solid made up of flat polygonal faces. The edges of these polygons are straight lines, and the faces themselves meet at vertices (points where edges intersect).
2. Prism \\ in Polyhedron : A Prism is a three-dimensional solid with two parallel, congruent polygonal bases and rectangular (or parallelogram) faces connecting the corresponding sides of the two bases.
3. Pyramid \\ in Polyhedron : A pyramid is a polyhedron with a polygonal base and triangular faces that converge at a single point (the apex).
4. Frustum \\ in Polyhedron : A frustum is a solid that results when a cone or pyramid is cut by a plane parallel to its base. The frustum has two bases: one larger than the other.

5. Platonic solids \\ in Polyhedron : All faces are congruent regular polygons. The same number of polygons meet at each vertex.

### Tetrahedron 三棱锥
1. Tetrahedron \\ in Pyramid : A tetrahedron is a polyhedron with four triangular faces.
2. Regular Tetrahedron \\ in Tetrahedron : A tetrahedron where all four faces are equilateral triangles.

## 四棱柱
1. Quadrilateral Prism \\ in Prism : A quadrilateral prism is a three-dimensional polyhedron that has two parallel, congruent quadrilateral bases and four rectangular lateral faces.
2. Parallelepiped \\ in Quadrilateral Prism : A parallelepiped is a six-faced (or "hexagonal") 3D figure in which each face is a parallelogram. It is a generalization of a rectangular prism and a cube.
3. Rectangular Prism \\ in Parallelepiped : A rectangular prism (also known as a **cuboid**) is a three-dimensional shape with six faces, all of which are rectangles. The opposite faces of a rectangular prism are congruent and parallel.
4. Cube \\ in Rectangular Prism : A cube is a special case of a rectangular prism where all the edges are of equal length.

## 含圆3维图形
1. Cylinder : A cylinder is a three-dimensional geometric figure with two parallel circular bases connected by a curved surface.
2. Cone : A cone is a three-dimensional geometric figure with a circular base and a single vertex (called the apex) not in the same plane as the base.
3. Sphere : A sphere is a three-dimensional geometric object where all points on the surface are equidistant from a fixed point called the center.


# Curve 曲线
1. Curve : curve is the set of all points that satisfy a particular mathematical condition or a set of conditions in a coordinate system. A curve can be represented in different forms such as Cartesian coordinates, polar coordinates, or parametric equations.

##  圆锥曲线
1. Conic Section \\ in Curve, on Plane : Conic sections are curves obtained by slicing a cone with a plane at different angles. Depending on the position and angle of the cutting plane.

## Circle 圆
1. Circle \\ in Ellipse : a simple, closed shape in geometry that consists of all points in a plane that are equidistant from a fixed point.
2. AnnularSector : (also known as a fan-shaped region) is a specific type of geometric region bounded by two radii and an arc of a circle.


## Ellipse 椭圆
1. Ellipse \\ in Conic Section : An ellipse is the set of points where the sum of the distances to two fixed points (foci) is constant.

##  Hyperbola 双曲线
1. Hyperbola \\ in Conic Section : A hyperbola is the set of points where the difference of the distances to two fixed points (foci) is constant.

## Parabola 抛物线
1. Parabola \\ in Conic Section : A parabola is a curve defined as the set of points equidistant from a fixed point (focus) and a line (directrix).
